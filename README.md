This repo contains a cloudflare worker skeleton that I used to allow a custom domain to map to a wixsite, without paying for a premium wix plan. This is done by using a cloudflare worker. It is based on fruitionsite.com, which similarly allows for custom domains to map to notion pages. Some specifics that were added in this repo for a wixsite were removing the wix banner, and allowing for buttons in to scroll to locations on the page as many wix pages are single page apps that use scrolling as navigation.
